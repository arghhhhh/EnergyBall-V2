# Energy Ball V2
Create and move energy balls using a Kinect V2 Camera. Built in Unity with VFX Graph.

Demoed at Frost Science Museum in August 2024.

Compared to [V1](https://github.com/arghhhhh/EnergyBall-V1), this project adds the following noteable enhancements:
* Better physics
* Multiplayer interaction
* Color customization

Under the hood, however, this is nearly a complete overhaul from the V1 project. 

## Requirements
- Kinect V2 Camera
- [Kinect SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561)
- **Important:** Import the missing Kinect DLLs from the [Kinect V2 Plugin for Unity](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=513177) to this project's assets folder. Only import the DLLs from the Unity package file; nothing else is needed from it.
