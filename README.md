Demoed at Frost Science Museum in August 2024.

Compared to [V1](https://github.com/arghhhhh/EnergyBall-V1), this project adds the following noteable enhancements:
* Better physics
* Multiplayer interaction
* Color customization

Under the hood, however, this is nearly a complete overhaul from the V1 project.
